    "The data we chose for the project comes from College Scorecard, a government initiative to provide unbiased and reliable information on the vast number of colleges and universities that operate in the United States. College Scorecard contains a number of metrics that can be used to asses institution’s prior performance, student outcomes and financial costs of attending. The dataset in available publically online and as a measure to protect privacy those metrics in the data set that end up with less than 30 students in the denominator are replaced with a ‘PrivacySuppressed’ label. The data is updated annually but we found the 2014-2015 dataset to be the most completed and used it for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In itself, College Scorecard is made of three smaller dataset that compliment each other. First dataset comes from yearly surveys administered by the Department of Education’s  National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The data is then collected and stored in the The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) which is a part of the NCES . Under the Higher Education Act, all institutions that participate in Title IV federal student aid programs must complete the IPEDS questionnaires. Thus, IPEDS is a great source of institutional statistics such as graduation rates for student subgroups, retention rates, tuition and cost of attendance. The has a severe limitation of only having graduation rates for full-time, first-time students. As a result, some metrics do not include those students who have previous higher education experience, transfer or part-time students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the dataset comes from National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). It is Department of Education’s central database for monitoring federal borrowers and grant recipients from as far back as 1960’s. NSLDS provides important financial metrics such as median loan debt and repayment rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of the College Scorecard is the  Administrative Earnings Data from Tax Records maintained by the Department of Treasury. This dataset describes the labor market outcomes for graduates of specific institutions. The data supplied in the College Scorecard contains each schools’ aggregated values for mean/median earnings among workers and percentiles of the earnings distribution for workers. "

    "**Who collected the data?**   \n",
    "Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and administrative tax records maintained by the Department of the Treasury. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When was the data collected?**   \n",
    "We chose the most recent and complete dataset which was collected for the 2015-2016 academic year. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How was the data collected?**   \n",
    "The data from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is collected through surveys. National Student Loan Data System pulls its data from FAFSA and other financial aid documents. Lastly, the portion of the data that comes from the Department of Treasury comes from W-2’s and other tax forms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Does this have any implications on our analysis?**  \n",
    "Most importantly, graduation rates are only reported for full-time, first-time students, so graduation rate information is not available for students who may have previous higher education experience or for part-time students.  Another limitation is that outcomes are not recorded for students who transfer from the institution. Thus, we have to be careful when we are generalizing and drawing conclusions from our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in order to protect privacy of students any field that has less than 30 people in the denominator is labeled ‘PrivacySuppressed’. This makes our analysis and conclusions only relevant for larger institutions. In addition, the financial information provided by FAFSA and the Department of Treasury only contains information on Title IV students. This means that we can only draw conclusions about those students who are eligible for Federal Financial Aid. \n"
